# Phizit - My Valheim modpack

A simple Valheim modpack for me and my friends.

This modpack comes with the following mods (more to be added in the future, probably) -

- [Custom Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/48)
- [Immersive Portals](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/268) - various portal improvements, such as shortened portal delay
- [Remember IP Damnit](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/41) - to remember the last used IP address
- [BepInEx configuration manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager) - for configuring mods in-game
- [Nexus Update Check](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/102) - to notify the user of updated versions of installed mods, if they have a Nexus ID configured
- [Map Sync](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/42)
